# Life

## Instructions

I'm writing instructions for life... haha!

Anyway.

First, create a **python 3** virtual environment. Once it's active, run:

    pip install -r requiremtents.txt

Once that's done, you should be good to go!

    python life.py

Enjoy!

Once you get bored, you can close the program with `ctrl-c`.
